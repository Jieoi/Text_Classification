attempt capture speech pattern feel many people bored rob roy simply understand character saying case read shakesphere put close captioning rob roy actually one greatest written film 90 many dialogue film clever maybe watch film couple time understand contrast dialogue braveheart hardly interesting course expect main character scotsman played australian legend clearly attempt capture speech time film take place several century rob roy yet talk like people today thus reason many people like better audience today become increasingly lazy want take time patience understand thing complex
