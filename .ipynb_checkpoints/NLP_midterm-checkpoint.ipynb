    "Our current generation has witnessed unprecedented global growth, be it in the economy or technology sectors. However, since the late 2010s, the landscape has undergone significant transformations. The conflicts around the world, deceleration in multiple sectors, and rise of protectionism have posed challenges to the old strategy of relying solely on continuous economic expansion. This challenge is fuelled by the unfavorable economic outlook observed since the 2020s. As a result, individuals have become more conservative and cautious in their spending habits. Consequently, businesses across sectors must vigilantly monitor shifts in consumer sentiment. By extracting insights from sentiment analysis, companies can understand consumer attitudes toward their products and services, as well as their overall brand image. This knowledge enables companies to promptly adapt and implement new strategies, ensuring their relevance in this volatile economic environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The film industry has been severely impacted by declining attendance, attributed to both slowing economic growth and a lack of compelling content. (sg) The coronavirus pandemic has further exacerbated the situation with lockdowns and admission restrictions. (us) Movie theaters now face fierce competition from alternative entertainment sources, especially video games, which experienced an impressive 20% growth in 2020. (us) To ensure continued prosperity, industry decision-makers must promptly reassess their strategies, giving paramount importance to audience opinions and feedback. Sentiment analysis becomes a critical tool for understanding audience preferences and sentiments, enabling the film industry to adapt and thrive in an ever-evolving entertainment landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the prevailing economic challenges, the film industry achieved a remarkable milestone in 2019, surpassing the $101 billion USD mark. This multi-billion-dollar industry still holds significant potential for prosperity. While attracting new consumers to choose movies as their primary source of entertainment may present difficulties, companies can focus on retaining their existing viewer base. Leveraging sentiment analysis, specifically tailored to movie reviews, becomes essential as it provides valuable insights into viewers' preferences and dislikes. By incorporating these insights, future movie productions can effectively cater to the preferences of the target audience, fostering continued success in the industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Factually speaking, the internet has become a vast database of opinions created by consumers. They express their thoughts through various channels such as Twitter, Facebook, IMDB, and Rotten Tomatoes. The model developed for sentimental analysis for the film industry can be transferred to and utilized in other sectors of the economy.  With appropriate refinement, this model has the potential to provide valuable insights into user sentiments in domains that may not have direct connections to the film industry. This demonstrates the versatility and applicability of sentiment analysis beyond its initial scope, offering a valuable tool for understanding consumer sentiment in diverse fields."
